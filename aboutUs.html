                  <p>When Laura signed up for Out and Up, she was suffering unemployment as a result of inadequate grades. However, she found something she loved - biking - and she developed a passion for it.</p><br>
                  <p class="quote-text">"As a result of joining Out and Up, I've been offered a job as a biking instructor, and the team-building aspect of the course showed employers that I could lead a group. It's definetely changed my life more than I could imagine."</p>

                  <p>Jack always loved the outdoors - and this allowed him a chance to push himself and enjoy the experience with friends.</p><br>
                  <p class="quote-text">"I thought I could beat anything they had to offer - and I did - but it was challenging, which I loved, as it gave me an opportunity to see what I was capable of. Also, I've gained experience with being in a team and I'm very grateful to Out and Up for that."</p>

                  <p class="quote-text">"When I joined, I had little thought of how this activity could lead me to be a much more social person and improve my team-building skills. I now have a higher level of social esteem - and I feel valued by society - and it wouldn't have been possible without Out and Up."</p>
